## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- `ObjectStorage.list_object_keys(*, bucket, prefix="")` — recursively streams
  every stored object key, the read primitive media-service-m8's orphan
  reconciler (Phase 14) needs to detect bytes that have no DB row. Stays
  DB-free and framework-agnostic.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- Initial `media_sdk_m8` package — the shared, settings-agnostic media SDK
  backbone consumed by media-service-m8 (producer) and media-worker-m8 (consumer).
- `media_sdk_m8.storage` — `ObjectStorage` MinIO wrapper plus `ObjectStorageConfig`
  and `get_minio_client`. The client is built from an explicit config (no service
  settings/env dependency); config carries the default presigned-URL lifetime
  (`presigned_expire_seconds`), overridable per call. Includes `put_object` for
  writing variant bytes.
- `media_sdk_m8.contracts` — Pydantic v2 producer↔consumer job contracts:
  `ScanJobPayload`, `VariantSpec`, `VariantJobPayload`.
- Packaging and quality config (`pyproject.toml`, CI workflow, PyPI workflow)
  targeting `media_sdk_m8`. Runtime dependencies: `minio` and `pydantic>=2`.
